;;; DEPENDENCY RULES
>#Dependency Rules
>Dependencies are specified with a filename or TGI and an HTTP URL, separated by a semicolon. I recommend using TGIs instead of filenames to ensure accurate results of a dependency scan - if a user changes a filename or datpacks their plugins, a required file might otherwise be missed. 
>Searching for TGIs is a new feature of this program.

>If you specify a TGI, each Type, Group, and Index number must be prefaced with 0x and no file extension may be included. 
>The separator between the Type, Group, and Index values is not important, as long as each number starts with 0x.

>#Conditional Dependencies
>Conditional dependencies will only trigger if a specified file or TGI is present. Specify a second filename or TGI right after the first, separated with two question marks [??].
>These are useful if there are options to inctall only certian parts of a mod, so the user will not be prompted for a missing dependency for a component they did not install.
>The first filename/TGI will show as a dependency if the second filename/TGI is present in plugins.
